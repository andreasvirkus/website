# Introduction

I am a 27-year-old guy who hails from Estonia and currently works in Skype as a service engineer for the Availability & Tools team. My day-to-day revolves around creating tooling in Bash, PowerShell and Python to help us reduce toil and increase productivity. 

Documenting everything I can is something I thoroughly enjoy as I believe it will make life easier down the road, and it has already paid dividends many times over! Who knew having things written down would save your bacon...

I feel right at home with both Windows and Linux, and am keen to learn how to automate even the simplest of tasks. It's only a matter of time before the task that takes you 5 minutes accumulates to hundreds of minutes *wasted* that could have been better spent!

Below you can find both my professional experience and my educational history jotted down in loose form, which I will take the time to improve later on into a more concise format for easier consumption.
