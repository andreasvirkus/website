To those that know me it's a well-known fact that I am quite partial to the "energy drink" [Belief](https://www.beliefwater.com/?lang=en). So much so that I've been steadily consuming it for the past couple of years on an  almost daily basis. Part of that has to do with my possibly unfounded _belief_ (rim shot) that it is far better for me than a drink like Red Bull or anything of that ilk. Of course, it would have been far better to not even drink Belief, but let's carry on.

Near the end of February last year I decided to really lean in to my habit/addiction and start noting down my purchases of it as I thought that if I am to ever be determined enough to kick this, then I'm much more likely to do so if I have some numbers to fall back on should I need additional rationalization.
