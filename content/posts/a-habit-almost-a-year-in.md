To those that know me it's a well-known fact that I am quite partial to the "energy drink" [Belief](https://www.beliefwater.com/?lang=en). So much so that I've been steadily consuming it for the past couple of years on an  almost daily basis. Part of that has to do with my possibly unfounded _belief_ (rim shot) that it is far better for me than a drink like Red Bull or anything of that ilk. Of course, it would have been far better to not even drink Belief, but let's carry on.

Near the end of February last year I decided to really lean in to my habit and start noting down my purchases of it as I thought that if I am to ever be determined enough to kick this, then I'm much more likely to do so if I have some numbers to fall back on.

I took my last sip of Belief on the 29th of December, 2020, which leaves the experiment, barring any setbacks, at 306 days starting from the 28th of February, 2020. During that time I wrote down the date, time, and location of the purchase of every bottle; also the chosen flavor, price, and whether it was discounted or not. What follows is a mishmash of facts based on those data points.
