title = "Venting on the lack of hind- and foresight"

+++
At 2:18 AM on the 25th of November the fitness and training-oriented company [My Fitness AS](https://www.teatmik.ee/en/personlegal/11273563-My-Fitness-AS) sent out an email with a subject that could be translated as "For your safety!❤️" (a sign of things to come if they can't even properly use spacing). I have not been able to stop thinking about it after reading that email the following morning, and I feel I have to vent to even possibly begin the process of letting it go.

This would normally result in a personal email to them, but I have zero reasons to believe that would move any meaningful gears within their system seeing as they were dumb enough to even think such a message would even suffice in this day and age.

Here is the content of that email, which is hopefully visible [here on their website](https://www.myfitness.ee/en/taiendavad-ennetusmeetmed-myfitnessi-spordiklubides/) as well (I've added the exact same points of emphasis they had in the original email):

> In order to make it safe for all of us to continue training, we have introduced additional preventive measures based on the orders of the government of the Republic of Estonia:
>
> * **When entering the club, a mask must be worn in the service area.** The mask is not mandatory in the gym, group trainings, SPA and locker rooms.
> * **The maximum occupancy of group training from 25.11 in Tallinn and Narva is 10 people + trainer.**
> * **From 25.11, we will reduce the duration of most training classes to 30 minutes**, in order to spread the workouts and offer different club members the opportunity to participate in group training.
> * **We continue to follow the 2 + 2 rule**.
> * **The use of a training towel is still mandatory** (on the mat, on the bench, on the training device, on the floor).
> * **We still disinfect equipment before and after training**.
>
> In addition, to protect the health and safety of our club members and visitors, we have taken the following measures:
>
> * **Contactless access to clubs** (including group training).
> * The club is equipped with hand and equipment **disinfectants**.
> * We have provided **masks and gloves** for the employees of the sports club.
> * **People with symptoms** are **prohibited** from visiting the clubs.
> * It is **obligatory** **to** **disinfect** training equipment and mats before and after use.
> * It is **obligatory** **to** **use a personal training towel** in each training session to avoid contact with the training equipment/mat.
> * The club **cleaning services** are elevated to a higher level.
> * The number of group trainings and participants is reduced.
> * We offer **long opening times**, which helps to disperse the intensity of visits.

In my opinion, there is just so much wrong with mostly everything written there. From their wording, their use of emphasis, and to their utter lack of understanding what had happened before to what will happen in the future if they continue with such _laissez-faire_ practices concerning health and well-being. Let's go through what I find to be so abhorrent.

***

I'll be referencing the Estonian government's latest (at the time of writing) restrictions that went into place on November 23rd, which can be seen [here](https://www.kriis.ee/en/news/government-approved-restrictions-prevent-spread-coronavirus), throughout this rebuking.

#### Point 1

> **When entering the club, a mask must be worn in the service area.** The mask is not mandatory in the gym, group trainings, SPA and locker rooms.

Chiefly among the latest government restrictions is:

> An obligation to wear a mask or to cover one's nose and mouth is introduced in public indoor spaces, including public transport and service points.

Where a "public indoor space" is defined as:

> \[...\] a space intended for public use that can be entered by anyone, regardless of the pre-registration requirement, for example; it is a place with many people who do not come into contact with each other on a daily basis.

Is it My Fitness' contention that the gym, group trainings, the spa, and locker rooms are **not** public spaces because the people in those areas come into contact with each other on a daily basis? Do they only allow in the same people who come into the gym every day? Do they make sure you only spend time with the same people outside of the gym as you do inside? Are they not allowing any new people to sign up who could break this magical herd's immunity? Or, are they just afraid of the inevitable ire of the people who are so opposed to any sort of mask-wearing that they would rather take their workouts elsewhere?

You might have noticed that I glossed over the very first sentence in the email and that wasn't by accident as I wanted to go over the first point prior to that as that makes the first sentence all the more glaring (emphasis mine):

> In order to make it safe for all of us to continue **training**

Try to now read their first point without questioning how the hell something like that could have ever made it out in to the open... 

It really does seem like they are having a hard time with wanting to seem compliant in terms of the law, but still wanting to have their own spin on the whole thing. It's the only way you could say something nonsensical like "additional preventive measures based on" and still think you're on the up and up.

#### Point 3

> **From 25.11, we will reduce the duration of most training classes to 30 minutes**, in order to spread the workouts and offer different club members the opportunity to participate in group training.
