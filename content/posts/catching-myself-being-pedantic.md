+++
Being pedantic comes with its own risks and rewards: on one hand you risk coming across as someone who desperately wants things their way and on the other hand there is both a subjective and a possibly objective reward to bringing attention to otherwise neglected areas. Subjective and _possibly_ objective rewards separately because something à la pedànt is always a reward for the initiator, but others can just be so blind to the objective win...

There are moments where I catch myself being overly pedantic about many things and in times such as those I am not taking into consideration the [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Chesterton%27s_fence) of it all. Though the term is being used to describe the physical I have come to believe we should also think of it as a way to help ourselves think more emphatically. For some people this may already be something they do automatically, but I'm not one of those, so I need mental models that are applicable for many different scenarios. One of those is the aforementioned Chesterton's fence.

When working with someone who does not share the same  beliefs about best practices that we do—be it for documenting, writing clean code, using version control, etc.—then it's easy to believe that they are wilfully ignorant to the _true_ way how to (software) engineer.
