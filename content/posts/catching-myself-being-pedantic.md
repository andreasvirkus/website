title = "Catching myself being pedantic"

+++
Being pedantic comes with its own risks and rewards: on one hand you risk coming across as someone who desperately wants things their way (despite knowing in your heart that your way is clearly _the_ right way and that you are not acting in malice) and on the other hand the level of precision the minutiae receive (perhaps though unwarranted) is far greater than they otherwise would have; without a doubt absolutely necessary as well...

There are moments where I catch myself being overly pedantic about many things and not taking into consideration the Chesterton's fence of it all. Despite the term being used to describe the physical (and the virtual) I have come to believe we should also think of it as tool for thinking emphatically. I'll talk about some examples both from the world inside and outside IT.
